# Dataloop_Assessment

## This assessment provides a hand-on of Dataloops SDK

The Data_Upload_and_Annotations.py creates a new project, dataset, uploads the images, adds UTM metadata, and then upload annotations.

query_1.py selects only image items that have been labeled as “top” and prints the item name and item id of each item

query_2.py retrieves all point annotations from the dataset and prints the  item name and item id of each item, and for each item, print for each annotation the annotation id, annotation label, and position of the point (x,y)
